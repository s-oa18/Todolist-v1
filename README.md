# Todolist Application


## Abstract
This application is built for the purpose of increasing productivity and improving the daily experiences of the average individual.   
Writing down your daily activities is a great way to plan ahead and enjoy a fulfilling day but it can be hectic when you always have to carry a journal.
The Todolist application aims to unburden people with the use of the traditional way of planning by simply using a web application, where one can 
write their daily activities and cross them out (delete) as they complete specific tasks.
